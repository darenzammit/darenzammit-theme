Add image styles - left, right, center
I like the medium.com left/right style with negative margin
Not sure about the central images, some do them wider than the text, others aligned - medium does both.
See if you need a bigger container to achieve bigger images or else maybe a negative margine could do.

Stylise all possible content including embeds - Twitter, FB, github, instagram and pinterest

Add Prism.js - try to get a theme similar to material theme for prism - in case I do videos it would look consistent

Style header and footer

I like an overlayed D + Z with multicolours

Consider using a very light grey instead of white for BG
